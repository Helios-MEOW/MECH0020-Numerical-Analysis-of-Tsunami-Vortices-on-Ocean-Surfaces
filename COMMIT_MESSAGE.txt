Comprehensive repository cleanup and reorganization

Execute complete repository cleanup following REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md:

STRUCTURE CHANGES:
- Create Scripts/Drivers/ for main entry points (Analysis.m, etc.)
- Create Scripts/Solvers/ with FD/ subdirectory for numerical kernels
- Rename Scripts/Visuals/ → Scripts/Plotting/ for clarity
- Create Data/Input/ (versioned) and Data/Output/ (gitignored)
- Remove empty directories: Scripts/Main/, Scripts/Methods/, Results/

FILE MOVES (39 renames, history preserved):
- 3 drivers → Scripts/Drivers/
- 11 solvers → Scripts/Solvers/ and Scripts/Solvers/FD/
- 6 test files → tests/
- 16 refactoring/cleanup docs → docs/markdown_archive/
- 1 architecture doc → docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/
- 1 plotting module → Scripts/Plotting/
- PROJECT_README.md → README.md (main entry point)

DELETIONS (4 files):
- Scripts/Main/Analysis.m (6627-line monolith, replaced by 119-line dispatcher)
- Results/*.csv, Results/*.mat (generated outputs, not source)

PATH UPDATES (8 files):
- Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m - Update header and all addpath calls
- Scripts/Drivers/run_adaptive_convergence.m - Update paths and output directory
- Scripts/Infrastructure/validate_simulation_parameters.m - Update directory checks
- tests/Run_All_Tests.m - Update all paths to new structure
- tests/verify_regression_fixes.m - Update paths and repo root handling
- tests/test_ui_startup.m - Update paths and critical file checks
- tests/test_refactoring.m - Update paths and verification logic
- .gitignore - Add Data/Output/, cleanup docs (root only)

NEW DOCUMENTATION:
- Data/Input/README.md - Guide for reference test cases
- docs/markdown_archive/CLEANUP_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md
- docs/markdown_archive/FINAL_VERIFICATION.md

BENEFITS:
- Repository size reduced by ~8.6 MB (deleted generated files)
- Clean root directory (README.md, spec, essential files only)
- Logical separation: Drivers/Solvers/Infrastructure/Plotting
- All tests centralized in tests/
- Historical documentation preserved in archive
- MECH0020 agent spec compliant structure

PATH MIGRATIONS:
Scripts/Main/      → Scripts/Drivers/
Scripts/Methods/   → Scripts/Solvers/ (and Solvers/FD/)
Scripts/Visuals/   → Scripts/Plotting/
Results/           → Data/Output/

VERIFICATION:
- All git mv operations preserve history
- All path references updated systematically
- Directory structure verified
- Ready for testing: UI, standard mode, test suite

Files changed: 54 (39 renames, 8 modifications, 4 additions, 4 deletions)
