feat: Repository cleanup and restructure per MECH0020 spec

SUMMARY
-------
Major repository reorganization to establish professional structure, remove
refactoring artifacts, and align with MECH0020_COPILOT_AGENT_SPEC.md.

CHANGES
-------

1. Root Directory Cleanup (21 → 3 files, -86%)
   - Moved 10 refactoring markdown docs to docs/markdown_archive/
   - Moved 6 test files to tests/
   - Deleted chat.json (8.5 MB), logs, diary (generated files)
   - Promoted PROJECT_README.md to README.md

2. Scripts Organization
   - Created Scripts/Drivers/ for entry points (3 files)
   - Created Scripts/Solvers/ for numerical kernels (11 files)
   - Created Scripts/Solvers/FD/ for FD-specific code (5 files)
   - Renamed Scripts/Visuals/ → Scripts/Plotting/
   - Removed Scripts/Main/ and Scripts/Methods/ (contents moved)

3. Analysis.m Modernization
   - Replaced old 6627-line monolith with 119-line dispatcher
   - Old: Scripts/Main/Analysis.m (pre-refactoring)
   - New: Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m (MECH0020-compliant)

4. Test Consolidation
   - Moved all 6 root test files to tests/
   - tests/ now contains 8 test files total
   - Improved test discoverability

5. Documentation Organization
   - Archived refactoring artifacts to docs/markdown_archive/
   - Moved OWL_Framework_Design.md to docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/
   - Created clear documentation hierarchy

6. Data Management
   - Created Data/Input/ for reference test cases
   - Created Data/Output/ for generated results (gitignored)
   - Removed Results/ directory (legacy, gitignored outputs)

7. Updated .gitignore
   - Added Data/Output/ exclusion
   - Added chat.json, comprehensive_test_log.txt exclusions
   - Retained Results/ exclusion for backwards compatibility

FILES AFFECTED
--------------

Deleted (5):
  - chat.json (8.5 MB)
  - comprehensive_test_log.txt
  - diary
  - TEST_COMPREHENSIVE.py
  - Scripts/Main/Analysis.m (old version)

Moved (28):
  - 3 entry points: Main/ → Drivers/
  - 11 solvers: Methods/ → Solvers/ (5 to Solvers/FD/)
  - 6 test files: root → tests/
  - 10 docs: root → docs/markdown_archive/
  - 1 design doc: docs/ → docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/
  - 1 readme: PROJECT_README.md → README.md

Path Updates (15 files):
  - Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m
  - Scripts/Infrastructure/ModeDispatcher.m
  - Scripts/Infrastructure/PathBuilder.m
  - Scripts/Infrastructure/initialize_directory_structure.m
  - All 6 test files in tests/
  - docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT_AND_FILE_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - .gitignore
  - README.md

IMPACT
------
- Repository size: -8.6 MB
- Root directory: 21 files → 3 files (-86%)
- Main entry point: 6627 lines → 119 lines (-98%)
- Professional structure aligned with MECH0020 specification
- Clear separation: Drivers vs Solvers vs Infrastructure
- Improved discoverability and maintainability

VERIFICATION
------------
✓ All tests pass: tests/Run_All_Tests.m
✓ UI launches successfully: Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m
✓ Convergence agent runs: Scripts/Drivers/run_adaptive_convergence.m
✓ No syntax errors in updated paths
✓ .gitignore properly excludes generated outputs

BREAKING CHANGES
----------------
- Scripts/Main/Analysis.m removed (use Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m)
- Scripts/Methods/ removed (use Scripts/Solvers/)
- Results/ directory removed (use Data/Output/)
- Test files moved from root to tests/

MIGRATION
---------
For users with existing workflows:
- Replace: Scripts/Main/Analysis.m → Scripts/Drivers/Analysis.m
- Replace: Scripts/Methods/* → Scripts/Solvers/* (or Scripts/Solvers/FD/*)
- Update paths in custom scripts to new directory structure
